> 
> Awesome! The software code should behave the way you expect with as many possible values or test cases.
> 
>  2.Question 2
> 
> What is the most basic way of testing a script?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 
>  Write code to do the tests. 
> 
>  Codifying tests into the software. 
> 

      Different parameters with expected results. 
> 
>  Let a bug slip through. 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Right on! The most basic way of testing a script is to use different parameters and get the expected results.
> 
>  3.Question 3
> 
> When a test is codified into its own software, what kind of test is it?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 
>  Unit test 
> 
>  Integration test 
>

      Automatic test 
> 
>  Sanity testing 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Nice job!  Codifying tests into its own software and code that can be run to verify that our programs do what we expect them to do is automatic testing.
> 
>  4.Question 4
> 
> Using _____ simplifies the testing process, allowing us to verify the program's behavior repeatedly with many possible values.
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 
>  integration tests 
> 

      test cases 
> 
>  test-driven development 
> 
>  interpreter 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Great work! Test cases automatically test with a range of possible values to verify the program’s behavior.
> 
>  5.Question 5
> 
> The more complex our code becomes, the more value the use of _____ provides in managing errors.
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 
>  loops 
> 
>  functions 
> 
>  parameters 
> 

      software testing 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Awesome! Software testing is the process of evaluating computer code to determine whether or not it does what you expect it to do, and the more complex the code, the more likely failure is.
