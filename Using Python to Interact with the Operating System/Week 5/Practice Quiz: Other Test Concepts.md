>  Smoke test 
> 
>  White-box test 
> 
>  Test-driven development 
> 

      Black-box test 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Nice work! This type of test relies on the tester having no knowledge of the code.
> 
>  2.Question 2
> 
> Verifying an automation script works well with the overall system and external entities describes what type of test?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 
>  Smoke test 
> 
>  Regression test 
> 
>  Load test 
> 

      Integration test 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Great job! This test verifies that the different parts of the overall system interact as expected.
> 
>  3.Question 3
> 
> _____ ensures that any success or failure of a unit test is caused by the behavior of the unit in question, and doesn't result from some external factor.

      Isolation 
> 
>  White-box testing 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Right on! By ensuring the unit of code we are testing is isolated, we can ensure we know where the bug originated.
> 
>  4.Question 4
> 
> A test that is written after a bug has been identified in order to ensure the bug doesn't show up again later is called _____
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 
>  Load test 
> 
>  Black-box test 
> 
>  Smoke test 
> 

      Regression test 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Excellent! Regression testing is a type of software test used to confirm that a recent program or code change has not adversely affected existing features, by re-executing a full or partial selection test cases.
> 
>  5.Question 5
> 
> What type of software testing is used to verify the softwareâ€™s ability to behave well under significantly stressed testing conditions?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 

      Load test 
> 
>  Black-box test 
> 
>  Smoke test 
> 
>  Regression test 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Way to go! Load testing verifies the behavior of the software remains consistent under conditions of significant load.
