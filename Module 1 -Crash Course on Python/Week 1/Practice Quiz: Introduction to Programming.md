> ## Practice Quiz: Introduction to Programming
> 
> Total points 5
> 
>  1.Question 1
> 
> What’s a computer program? 
> 
>  A set of languages available in the computer 
> 
>  A process for getting duplicate values removed from a list 
> 
>  A list of instructions that the computer has to follow to reach a goal 
> 
>  A file that gets copied to all machines in the network 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> You nailed it! At a basic level, a computer program is a recipe of instructions that tells your computer what to do.

>  2.Question 2
> 
> What’s the syntax of a language? 
> 
>  The rules of how to express things in that language 
> 
>  The subject of a sentence 
> 
>  The difference between one language and another 
> 
>  The meaning of the words 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Right on! In a human language, syntax is the rules for how a sentence is constructed, and in a programming language, syntax is the rules for how each instruction is written.

>  3.Question 3
> 
> What’s the difference between a program and a script? 
> 
>  There’s not much difference, but scripts are usually simpler and shorter. 
> 
>  Scripts are only written in Python. 
> 
>  Scripts can only be used for simple tasks. 
> 
>  Programs are written by software engineers; scripts are written by system administrators. 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> You got it! The line between a program and a script is blurry; scripts usually have a shorter development cycle. This means that scripts are shorter, simpler, and can be written very quickly.

>  4.Question 4
> 
> Which of these scenarios are good candidates for automation? Select all that apply. 
> 
>  Generating a sales report, split by region and product type 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Excellent! Creating a report that presents stored data in specific ways is a tedious task that can be easily automated.
> 
>  Creating your own startup company 
> 
>  Helping a user who’s having network troubles 
> 
>  Copying a file to all computers in a company 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Nice work! A task like copying files to other computers is easily automated, and helps to reduce unnecessary manual work.
> 
>  Interviewing a candidate for a job 
> 
>  Sending personalized emails to subscribers of your website 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Great job! Sending out periodic emails is a time-consuming task that can be easily automated, and you won't have to worry about forgetting to do it on a regular basis.
> 
>  Investigating the root cause of a machine failing to boot 
> 
> 1 / 1 point
> 
>  5.Question 5
> 
> What are semantics when applied to programming code and pseudocode? 
> 
>  The rules for how a programming instruction is written 
> 
>  The difference in number values in one instance of a script compared to another 
> 
>  The effect the programming instructions have 
> 
>  The end result of a programming instruction 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Nice job! Like human language, the intended meaning or effect of words, or in this case instructions, are referred to as semantics.
