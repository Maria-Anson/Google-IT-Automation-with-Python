>  5.Question 5
> 
> If a filesystem has a block size of 4096 bytes, this means that a file comprised of only one byte will still use 4096 bytes of storage. A file made up of 4097 bytes will use 4096*2=8192 bytes of storage. Knowing this, can you fill in the gaps in the calculate_storage function below, which calculates the total number of bytes needed to store a file of a given size?

    > 
    > # Use floor division to calculate how many blocks are fully occupied
    > 
    > full_blocks = filesize//block_size
    > 
    > # Use the modulo operator to check whether there's any remainder
    > 
    > partial_block_remainder = filesize%block_size
    > 
    > # Depending on whether there's a remainder or not, return
    > 
    > # the total number of bytes required to allocate enough blocks
    > 
    > # to store your data.
    > 
    > if partial_block_remainder > 0:
    > 
    > return full_blocks*4096 + 4096
    > 
    > return full_blocks * 4096
    > 
    > print(calculate_storage(1)) # Should be 4096
